NAME
    Mandel - Async model layer for MongoDB objects using Mango

SYNOPSIS
      package MyModel;
      use Mandel;

      package MyModel::Cat;
      use Mandel::Document;
      field [qw( name type )];
      belongs_to person => 'MyModel::Person';

      package MyModel::Person;
      use Mandel::Document;
      field [qw( name age )];
      has_many cats => 'MyModel::Cat';
      has_one favorite_cat => 'MyModel::Cat';

      package main;
      my $connection = MyModel->connect("mongodb://localhost/my_db");
      my $persons = $connection->collection('person');

      my $p1 = $persons->create({ name => 'Bruce', age => 30 });
      $p1->save(sub {
        my($p1, $err) = @_;
      });

      $persons->count(sub {
        my($persons, $n_persons) = @_;
      });

      $persons->all(sub {
        my($persons, $err, $objs) = @_;
        for my $p (@$objs) {
          $p->age(25)->save(sub {});
        }
      });

      $persons->search({ name => 'Bruce' })->single(sub {
        my($persons, $err, $person) = @_;

        $person->cats(sub {
          my($person, $err, $cats) = @_;
          $_->remove(sub {}) for @$cats;
        });

        $person->remove(sub {
          my($person, $err) = @_;
        });
      });

DESCRIPTION
    THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE! THE API MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME! PLEASE
    CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR FEEDBACK.

    Mandel is an async object-document-mapper. It allows you to work with
    your MongoDB documents in Perl as objects.

    This class binds it all together:

    *   Mandel::Model

        An object modelling a document.

    *   Mandel::Collection

        A collection of Mandel documents.

    *   Mandel::Document

        A single MongoDB document with logic.

ATTRIBUTES
    Mandel inherits all attributes from Mojo::Base and implements the
    following new ones.

  namespaces
    The namespaces which will be searched when looking for Types. By
    default, the (sub)class name of this module.

  model_class
    Returns Mandel::Model.

  storage
    An instance of Mango which acts as the database connection. If not
    provided.

METHODS
    Mandel inherits all methods from Mojo::Base and implements the following
    new ones.

  connect
      $self = $class->connect(@connect_args);
      $clone = $self->connect(@connect_args);

    @connect_args will be passed on to "new" in Mango, which again will be
    set as "storage".

    Calling this on an object will return a clone, but with a fresh
    "storage" object.

  all_document_names
      @names = $self->all_document_names;

    Returns a list of all the documents in the "namespaces".

  class_for
      $document_class = $self->class_for($name);

    Given a document name, find the related class name, ensure that it is
    loaded (or else die) and return it.

  collection
      $collection_obj = $self->collection($name);

    Returns a Mango::Collection object.

  model
      $model = $self->model($name);
      $self = $self->model($name => \%model_args);
      $self = $self->model($name => $model_obj);

    Define or returns a Mandel::Model object. Will die unless a model is
    registered by that name or "class_for" returns a class which has the
    "model()" method defined.

  initialize
      $self->initialize(@names);
      $self->initialize;

    Takes a list of document names. Calls the "initialize" in
    Mango::Document method on any document given as input. @names default to
    "all_document_names" unless specified.

  import
    See "SYNOPSIS".
